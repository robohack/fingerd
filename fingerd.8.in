.TH FINGERD 8 "1997 April 5" "$Name:  $" "Local Internet Daemons"
.SH NAME
fingerd \- remote user information server
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@sbindir@/fingerd\fR [\fB-p progname\fR] [\fB-lufiIsmb\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfingerd\fR implements the server side of the the Name/Finger protocol,
specified in \s-2RFC\s0 1288.  The Name/Finger protocol provides a remote
interface to programs which display information on system status and
individual users.  The protocol imposes little structure on the format of the
exchange between client and server.  The client provides a single
\*(lqcommand line\*(rq to the finger server which returns a printable reply.
.LP
\fBfingerd\fR is normally run by
.BR inetd (8),
and waits for connections on port 79.  Once connected it reads a single
command line terminated by a \s-1LINEFEED\s0.  If the command line is empty,
it checks the access file (see below) to see if user listings from
the originating host & user are permitted.  If user listings are allowed,
fingerd executes
.BR finger (1)
with the appropriate options.
.LP
If the command line contains a user name fingerd checks the \fBusers\fR file
(see below) to see if the user-name is listed.  If the requested user name is
listed in the config file, the program listed in the user's file is run with
the arguments specified.  Otherwise
.BR finger (1)
is run with the appropriate options and the requested user-name.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-l\fR Log all accepted and refused finger requests.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR Do not allow user listings.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR Do not forward finger requests.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR Attempt \s-2RFC\s0 1413 compliant ident queries.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR Same as \fB\-i\fR but reject the connection if the query fails.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR Refuse connections if can not resolve hostname.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR Tells finger to do a short listings by default.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR Tells finger to do only exact matches.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR Tells finger not to print user's shell and home directory.
.TP
\fB\-p progname\fR Use \fIprogname\fR as the finger program.
.SH "ACCESS FILE"
\fBfingerd\fR enables you to accept and refuse queries depending on the
client's hostname and/or username.  The path name for the access file is
normally \fI@datadir@/@PACKAGE@/access\fR.
The format of the file is:
.IP
\fIuser-name@host-name	permission\fR
.LP
\fBfingerd attempts to match the remote user's name and the remote host's name
with what is in the access file.  If a match is found, \fBpermission\fR
is used to process the request.  Both the \fBuser-name\fR and the
\fBhostname\fR can either be literal strings or wildcards.  The first line to
match the request is the one used.
.LP
\fBpermission\fR must be one of the following:
.TP
\fInone\fR \- deny all access.
.TP
\fInoforward\fR \- do not forward finger requests.
.TP
\fInolist\fR \- disallow user lists.
.TP
\fIforceident\fR \- fail if ident queries fail.
.TP
\fIall\fR \- grant default access.
.LP
Command line options take precedence over the access file.
.SH "USERS FILE"
\fBfingerd\fR enables you to assign different programs to specific user
names.  This option is useful for vending machines and other services that
use finger to report information.  The path name for the \fBusers\fR file
is normally \fI@datadir@/@PACKAGE@/users\fR.
The format of the file is:
.IP
\fIuser-name	program [args]\fR
.LP
\fBuser-name\fR is the user-name to match against.  This must be a literal
match; wildcards are not accepted.
\fBprogram [args]\fR is the full pathname of the program to run and the
arguments you wish to give it.  If you specify
\fI%U\fR as an argument it will get replaced with the remote user's
name.  If you specify \fI%H\fR it will get replaced with the remote
host's name.  To pass in a literal \fI%U\fR or \fI%H\fR prepend it with
another \fI%\fR.

.SH BUGS
The handling %H and %U in the user file is pretty primative and broken.
.sp
On some systems (at least SunOS 4.1.3) inetd only passes 4 command line
options to the daemon it runs, so you should condense command line options.
.br
So instead of saying:
.RS
.B "fingerd -f -s -l -u"
.RE
say
.br
.RS
.B "fingerd -fslu"
.RE
Trusting \fBidentd\fR is a silly thing to do, esp. for hosts you don't
directly control.
