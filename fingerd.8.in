.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
implements the server side Remote User Information Program
.Dv ( RUIP )
of the the Finger (or Name) protocol, specified in
.Tn "RFC 1288" .
The Finger protocol provides a remote interface to programs which
display information on system status and individual users.  The protocol
imposes little structure on the format of the exchange between client
and server.  The client provides a single command line to the
.Nm
server which normally returns a friendly human-oriented status report
listing the users of the system at the moment, or an in-depth report of
information about a particular user.
.Pp
.Nm
is started by
.Xr inetd 8 ,
which is normally configured to listen for connections on
.Tn TCP
port 79.  Once a client has connected the connection is handed to
.Nm
which reads a single command line terminated by
.Tn ASCII
carriage-return and linefeed characters.
.Pp
.Nm
uses an access control file (see below) to see if user listings from the
originating host (and user) are permitted, and what permissions are
granted to the client host (and user).  If user listings are allowed,
and if the request sepcifies a user name
.Nm
checks to see if that user-name is listed in a users file (see below).
If the requested user name is listed in this file, the program specified
for that user-name is run.  Otherwise the
.Xr finger 1
program is run with the appropriate options.
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-c confdir"
.It Fl b
Tell
.Nm finger
not to print user's shell and home directory.  (Note that this option
may not work with all versions of
.Nm finger . )
.It Fl c Ar confdir
Look for configuration files in
.Dq Ar confdir
instead of the default directory
.Pq Pa @PATH_SYSCONFDIR@ .
.It Fl f
Allow forwarding of
.Nm finger
requests.
.It Fl g
Tell
.Nm finger
not to show any
.Dq GECOS
information (normally the user's office location and office phone
number) besides the users' real names.
.It Fl h
Tell
.Nm finger
to show the remote hostname the user is logged in from, if any (in
.Dq short
mode) instead of the office location and office phone.
.It Fl H
Forces
.Nm finger
to use the hostname format as in
.Fl h .
.It Fl i
Attempt
.Tn "RFC 1413"
compliant user identification queries.
.It Fl I
Same as
.Fl i
but reject the connection if the
.Dq ident
query fails.
.It Fl l
Log all
.Nm finger
requests.  The name of the host originating the query, possibly the
.Dq Em ident
reply, along with the actual request is reported via
.Xr syslog 3
at
.Dv LOG_NOTICE
priority using the
.Dv LOG_DAEMON
facility.
.It Fl m
Tell
.Nm finger
to do only exact matches.
.Ar User
is usually a login name; however, matching will also be done on the
users' real names, unless the
.Fl m
option is supplied.
.It Fl p
Tell
.Nm finger
not to show the user's
.Pa ~/.plan
or
.Pa ~/.project
files in
.Dq long
listings.
.It Fl P Ar finger
Use an alternate
.Ar finger
program as the local information provider.  The default local program
executed by
.Nm
is
.Xr finger 1 .
The program must be specified by its fully qualified pathname.
.It Fl r
Refuse connections if the remote hostname cannot be resolved.
.It Fl s
Tells
.Nm finger
to do short listings by default, one line per user.  This option
normally has effect only when
.Fl m
is
.Em not
specified and the query matches more than one user-name.
.It Fl S
Tell
.Nm finger
to force short listings.  This overrides any request by the remote
client for a verbose report.
.It Fl u
Queries without a user name are rejected.
.El
.\"
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
.\"
.Ss Message File
.Nm
will send the contents of a message file before running the finger
program.  The path name for the message file is normally
.Pa @PATH_SYSCONFDIR@/fingerd.motd .
.\"
.Ss Access File
.Nm Fingerd
enables you to accept and refuse queries depending on the client's
hostname and/or username.  The path name for the access file is normally
.Pa @PATH_SYSCONFDIR@/fingerd.acl .
The format of the file is:
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent
.Bo Ar client-user Ns Sy @ Bc Ar client-host-name
.Ar permission
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
attempts to match the remote user's name (if available from an
.Dq ident
query, and if specified) and the remote host's name with what is in the
access file.  If a match is found,
.Dq Em permission
is used to process the request.  Both the
.Dq Em client-user
and the
.Dq Em client-host-name
can either be literal strings or wildcard expressions (ala
.Xr sh 1
.Dq glob
patterns).  The first line to match the request is the one used to set
the permissions.
.Pp
The value of
.Dq Em permission
must be one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width defaultshowhost -compact
.It none
deny all access.
.It forward
allow forwarding of finger requests (same as
.Fl f ) .
.It nogecos
do not show GECOS information (same as
.Fl g ) .
.It nohome
do not show user's home directory location (same as
.Fl b ) .
(Note that this option may not work with all versions of
.Nm finger . )
.It nolist
disallow user lists (same as
.Fl u ) .
.It nomatch
do not match on fullname (same as
.Fl m ) .
.It noplan
do not show user's
.Pa ~/.plan ,
etc. files (same as
.Fl p ) .
.It forceident
fail if ident queries fail (same as
.Fl I ) .
.It forceshort
force short reply only (same as
.Fl S ) .
.It defaultshort
default to short reply (same as
.Fl s ) .
.It showhost
show user's remote host instead of office information (same as
.Fl h ) .
.El
.Pp
Command line options set the global defaults and cannot be reset with
the access file, but access file permissions allow specific refinement
of options.
.\"
.Ss Users File
.Nm Fingerd
enables you to assign different programs to specific user names.  This
option is useful for vending machines and other services that use finger
to report information.  The path name for the \fBusers\fR file is
normally
.Pa @PATH_SYSCONFDIR@/fingerd.users .
The format of the file is:
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent
.Ar name Ar program Op Ar args ...
.Ed
.Pp
Lines beginning with
.Dq Li #
are ignored.
.Pp
The value of
.Dq Em name
is the user-name to match against.  This must be a literal match;
wildcards and regular expressions are not accepted.  The 
.Pp
The remainder of the line,
.Dq Em program Op args ...
should consist of the full pathname of the program to run and the
arguments you wish to give it.  If you specify
.Dq Li %U
anywhere it will be replaced with the remote user's name.  If you
specify
.Dq Li %H
it will be replaced with the remote host's name.  To pass a literal
.Dq Li %
to a command you can prepend it with another
.Dq Li % .

.\"
.Sh BUGS
The handling of
.Dq Li %H
and
.Dq Li %U
in the
.Dq users
file is pretty primitive and broken.
.Pp
On some systems (at least SunOS 4.1.3)
.Xr inetd 8
only passes a maximum of four(4) command line options to the daemon it
runs, so you should condense command line options.
So instead of using:
.Dq Li "fingerd -f -s -l -u"
use
.Dq Li "fingerd -fslu" .
.Pp
Trusting
.Tm "RFC 1413"
and similar
.Dq ident
protocol results is a silly thing to do, especially for hosts you don't directly
control.
.Pp
There should be some way to return only the very minimum required amount
of information, i.e. the user's full name (as per
.Tn "RFC 1288"
Section 3.2.3).  The combination of
.Fl S
and
.Fl g
comes close, but still reveals the users's login terminal, time, and
idleness with most implementations of
.Nm finger .
.\"
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
This version of
.Nm
reverses the meaning of the
.Fl f
option from that traditional to BSD implementations.  The new default
matches the recommendations in
.Tn "RFC 1288" ,
and we echo the recommendation that forwarding
.Em not
be enabled (i.e. do
.Em not
use
.Fl f ) .
.Pp
.Tn "RFC 1288"
suggests that the
.Dq "user list"
feature be disabled to avoid giving away potentially sensitive
information about the users of a system.  Similarly it is recommended
that the
.Fl m
option be used to prevent
.Nm finger
from attempting to find a matching user name.  Administrators can also
prevent the display of user office locations and phone numbers by using
the
.Fl g
option.
.Pp
.Tn "RFC 1288"
suggests that
.Dv RUIP
(Remote User Information Program)
servers should not send the contents of
.Dq "user information files"
and this can be prevented on most systems by using the
.Fl p
option.
.Pp
The ability to execute arbitrary programs is very dangerous and should
be used
.Em only
with great care, especially since it's also possible to pass information
gathered from the network to these programs.
