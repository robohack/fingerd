* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.90.

(formerly 'finger -l' would make it think a user name had been given).
- new '-S' option to force short replies ('finger -s').
- new acl options "forceshort" and "defaultshort" to match '-S' and '-s'
  options respectively.

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.81.

- This release adds more complete automake/autoconf support.

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.80.

- This is a clean-up release with the primary purpose of introducing
  a more stable and automated build system.  No new features exist.

The baseline for this code is approximately fingerd-1.3 by Michael S.
