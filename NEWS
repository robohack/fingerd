* User-visible changes new in $Name:  $.


* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.4.

- added a '-c config-dir' option to allow over-riding the compiled in
  default directory.
- renamed the configuration files to have the "fingerd." prefix so that
  they can be installed in the normal "sysconfdir".

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.94.

- The '-f' option now *enables* fowarding, making the default match the
  long standing recommendations in RFC 1288.
- The manual page has been translated to the 4.4BSD mdoc(7) format and
  upated significantly.
- yet better automake/autoconf support.
- more complete options support (esp. for 4.4BSD finger(1) features).

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.90.

- fixed the handling of user list denial to work properly in all cases
  (formerly 'finger -l' would make it think a user name had been
  given).
- new '-S' option to force short replies ('finger -s').
- new acl options "forceshort" and "defaultshort" to match '-S' and '-s'
  options respectively.

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.81.

- This release adds more complete automake/autoconf support.

* User-visible changes new in Fingerd Release 1.3.80.

- This is a clean-up release with the primary purpose of introducing
  a more stable and automated build system.  No new features exist.

The baseline for this code is approximately fingerd-1.3 by Michael S.
Shanzer <shanzer@foobar.com>.

New in this version 1.3:
	- added an option to refuse connections from hosts we can
	  not resolve.
	- can bind a program to [user list] in users file.
	- do a gethostname() lookup on what gethostbyname() returned
	  to try and make sure that someone did not put in a bogus
	  IN-ADDR record.
	- user names in the user file are now case-insensitive (kelly@nine.org)
	- added nomatch to the config file so certain hosts can do fuzzy
	  user name matching (kelly@nine.org)
	- using latest rfc931 code (wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl)


New in this version 2.0:
	- cleaned up old porting mess.
