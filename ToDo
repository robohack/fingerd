- Think of some way to safely allow users to specify that they don't
  want to be fingered in case the local finger command doesn't support
  this usage (commonly done with "~/.nofinger", but in that case treat a
  closed home-dir as if the file was present -- remember, we should be
  running as nobody).

- possibly add a REJECT or similar pseudo-command for fingerd.users

- possibly free all allocated memory more carefully
