FINGERD -- A safer and more configurable version of this infamous daemon

This is an updated version of a package put together by Mike Shanzer.

This package a new more functional version of the traditional fingerd.

What does this fingerd have to offer?

	- it has much enhanced logging.

	- it supports access control lists:  you can restrict finger
	  requests to certain hosts (and certain users if you trust
	  identd).

	- it sports a "message of the day" file for announcements.

	- it can bind program program execution to finger attempts for
	  specified users and will return the output of such programs to
	  the remote uer.


TO BUILD FINGERD

Please see the file "INSTALL" for overall instructions on how to
configure and build this package.

In general you need only run "./configure && make && make install"

To install fingerd in a local directory but at the same time replace the
system binary, you should be able to run "make install-symlinks" after
having built and installed it as above.  This wil safely move aside the
vendor binary and install a symlink to your brand new custom fingerd.
