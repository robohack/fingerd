This is a new more functional version of fingerd.
What does this fingerd have to offer? 

	- logging 
	- access control lists, so you can restrict finger requests to 
	  certain hosts (and certain users if you trust identd)
	- a message of the day file.
	- binding programs to certain users

New in this version 1.3:
	- added an option to refuse connections from hosts we can
	  not resolve.
	- can bind a program to [user list] in users file.
	- do a gethostname lookup on what gethostbyname returned
	  to try and make sure that someone did not put in a bogus
	  IN-ADDR record.
	- user names in the user file are now case-insensitive (kelly@nine.org)
	- added nomatch to the config file so certain hosts can do fuzzy
	  user name matching (kelly@nine.org)
	- using new rfc931 code (wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl)

TO BUILD FINGERD
edit fingerd.h and fix the pathnames and syslog facility to something
appropriate.

edit the Makefile.  Set the STRERROR varible to strerror.o if your
machine does not have strerror(3) inthe C-libary (SunOS)

change BINDIR to be where you want to install fingerd.

The man page that comes with fingerd is pretty poor, so here is a
brief description:

First fingerd options:
	-l - enable logging. fingerd does its logging via syslog(3), and it
	     uses the LOCAL3 facility.  it logs both successful and failed
	     finger attempts.
	-i - tells fingerd to try and use identd to figure out the
	     remote user who is doing the finger.
	-I - same as -i except that if it can not talk to the ident on the
	     remote machine, the request is refused.
	-u - do not allow remote users to get an user list.
	-f - do forward finger requests (finger @host1@host2).
	-s - by default run finger -s unless remote user specified -l
	-m - run finger -m (do not attempt user matching)
	-b - run finger -b (do not print home directory and shell)
	-p prog - specify a different program to run instead
		  of /usr/ucb/finger.

Config. Files:
	/usr/local/lib/finger/motd: message of the day. print this file out
			     when a finger request is accepted.
	/usr/local/lib/finger/access: a list of users and host which you
			       either want to allow to finger you, or
			       ones you want to specificly deny. 
			       Look in the samples directory for
			       examples on how to set this file up.
	/usr/local/lib/finger/users:	a list of users that when fingered
				should have a different program run then
				the standard finger program. If you want the
				remote host and/or the remote user to be
				arguments to the program specify the arguments
				as %H and %U respectivly. If you want
				the %H/%U literal to be an argument specify
				it with two % signs (%%H %%U).
				Look in the samples directoy for some 
				examples.

		*WARNING* the remote user is gotten via identd (rfc 1413)
			  this data should not be considered trustworthy.
