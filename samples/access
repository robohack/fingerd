#
# fingerd access control list
#
#	noforward -- do not allow forwarded fingers 
#	forceident -- reject if remote host not running identd
#	nolist -- do not allow listing of users logged in
#	nomatch -- do not match on first&last names (finger -m)
#	none -- access denied 
#
# The first line that matches is the the line that'll apply.
# There is no default -- use '*' to match any host or user.
#
# Command line options take precedence to what is in the file,
# so for example if you specify '-f' on the fingerd command line
# you do not neet to put noforward in here cause it applies to all
# connections.  The 'forceident' always fails if fingerd was not
# invoked with either '-i' or '-I'.
